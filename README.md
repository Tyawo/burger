# Burger with Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app also keeps a database updated, whether a burger is devoured or not.


### APPLICATIONS OR TECHNOLOGY USED

MySQL to manage data

Node to create route data,

Express to export function,

ORM, to access and manipulate object and 

Handlebars to generate your HTML.


### How it works

User are presented with ready-to-order burgers list they can choose from and eat. When the "devour it button" is clicked, the selected burger is removed from the List and placed on the already eaten burgers list on the right side.
Also, the user can add his own sandwich. It will be displayed in the list of available burgers on the left side. 
Notice that each time a sandwich is eaten or added, the database is updated to account for the change.
